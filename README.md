"An attempt towards zero waste and green environment with recycling" 

# What's the Problem?

In present time, addressing the waste and shifting to environmental sustainability has become a major topic and challenging as well.
One of the more pressing challenges in addressing waste and shifting to a more circular economy is the increasing complexity of the products. In an attempt to make them more advanced, their recovery and reuse gets neglected and thus they become more challenging for the environment. We should try to the best of our ability to increase the reuse of materials that is, we should promote recycling. Only then we can promote responsible production and green consumption

# The Idea

We propose creating a transparent and trustworthy platform for trading resources and knowledge as well as providing access to a community of experts. The approach of this web app “GREEN TRASH” is to automate and extend the rate of recycling procedure with tech-support and to establish a connection among the people and organizations dealing in waste-to-product conversion. The residents will be able to know about various recycling techniques and waste collection points near their locality where they can sell and buy recyclable materials. In turn they can make some money with the waste they are going to sell.
